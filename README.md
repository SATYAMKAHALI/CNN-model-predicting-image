Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are the fundamentals of Computer Vision.
Here I have created a full CNN using keras.
Keras makes the implementation easier by reducing the line of codes.Kudos to the people making open source libraries as they reduce the line of codes significantly.
Here the loss function I have used is binary cross entropy loss as it is a binary problem to choose between cat or dog.
The flattenning input layers are around 64 where relu activation function is used and the output layer contains 1 neuron which uses sigmoid function for the output.
